# Inclusive-Leader-Program
The Inclusive Leader Program by AAA empowers students as allies and inclusion champions. Co-designed with disabled youth, it builds empathy, skills, and action through interactive modules. Students take an Ally Pledge and can earn an Inclusive Leader Award, recognised by schools and community.
